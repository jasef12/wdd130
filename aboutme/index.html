    <h2>Jase Foster</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Jase. I am from Blackfoot Idaho, and this is my third semester at BYUI. I love to dirtbike, snowmobile, and rodeo. I team rope mostly but have calf roped in my career so far. I love sports and being active in any way. I returned from my mission in december last year from Canada. I'm still adjusting somewhat to normal life and it's been interesting. I'm excited to be able to learn about web design more and see how I can use it in my future. I hope one day to start my own business.</p>
