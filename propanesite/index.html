                <p class="para"> Jase's Tank Painting is a business made by Jase Foster, and it's purpose is to bring my skills and experience to the locals of Blackfoot, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, and surrounding towns and areas.I worked for a company called Miller Gas and was part of their summer painting crew for two summers. 
            I really enjoyed the job and would like to continue giving that service to people. For those that have personal propane tanks that are located on the property with easy access that have surface damage from weather and time. I want to make your tank look brand new and the way I do that is by scraping and smoothing 
            those spots on your tank that don't look good. I then make sure your tank is clean all around the bottom and the sides, taking away debri or grass and dirt underneath. I then will repaint your tank you look like it was just dropped 
            off of the truck. With a fresh white shine, it'll have your neighbors in aw. Let me help you bring that part of your yard back to life and I'll come paint your tank today. I'm looking to just scratch one more thing off of that stress
            list and bring a bit more relief into your life. Jase's Tank Painting will get the job done fast and easy with no mess. My painting is done with rollers and paint brushes, no spraying. 

            I will paint tanks from 250 gallons up to 2000 gallons. I don't have resources to go bigger than that, but any of those sizes I can so. Prices will adjust according to size of the tank and that will be shown on page two.
            If you're wanting a tank painted, you will be able to contact me through information I have on the website. The purpose of this website is to allow you to easily locate pricing of the project you want done, and easily set up your own 
            reservation with the system I have provided you. Further on, I will continue to created a software that will allow you to make and account and have all of your info saved into my database so that reservations will be even more simple and speedy.
