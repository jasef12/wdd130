            <p>This page shows my pricing for the different sizes of tanks that I can paint. If you want to sign up on the website, I do require some information. I will need an address and phone number with a full name as well. I ask that your address
                is up to date and accurate. Also leave instructions if you have animals or if your tank is in a weird spot, because I want to stay safe on your property. I will be showing up early in the morning or late in the evening
                to stay out of the hot weather. If the forcast predicts rain, I will not paint for those days. If that is the case, your reservation will be moved to a different day.</p>
