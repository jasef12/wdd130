          Jase's Tank Painting is a business made by Jase Foster, and it's purpose is to bring my skills and experience to the locals of Blackfoot, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, and surrounding towns and areas.I worked for a company called Miller Gas and was part of their summer painting crew for two summers. 
          I really enjoyed the job and would like to continue giving that service to people. For those that have personal propane tanks that are located on the property with easy access that have surface damage from weather and time. I want to make your tank look brand new and the way I do that is by scraping and smoothing 
        those spots on your tank that don't look good. I then make sure your tank is clean all around the bottom and the sides, taking away debri or grass and dirt underneath. I then will repaint your tank you look like it was just dropped 
        off of the truck. With a fresh white shine, it'll have your neighbors in aw. Let me help you bring that part of your yard back to life and I'll come paint your tank today. I'm looking to just scratch one more thing off of that stress
        list and bring a bit more relief into your life. Jase's Tank Painting will get the job done fast and easy with no mess. My painting is done with rollers and paint brushes, no spraying. 

          I will paint tanks from 250 gallons up to 2000 gallons. I don't have resources to go bigger than that, but any of those sizes I can so. Prices will adjust according to size of the tank and that will be shown on page two.
        If you're wanting a tank painted, you will be able to contact me through information I have on the website. The purpose of this website is to allow you to easily locate pricing of the project you want done, and easily set up your own 
        reservation with the system I have provided you. Further on, I will continue to created a software that will allow you to make and account and have all of your info saved into my database so that reservations will be even more simple and speedy.

      <h3>Prices and Rates</h3>
      <p>
        This page shows my pricing for the different sizes of tanks that I can paint. If you want to sign up on the website, I do require some information. I will need an address and phone number with a full name as well. I ask that your address
        is up to date and accurate. Also leave instructions if you have animals or if your tank is in a weird spot, because I want to stay safe on your property. I will be showing up early in the morning or late in the evening
        to stay out of the hot weather. If the forcast predicts rain, I will not paint for those days. If that is the case, your reservation will be moved to a different day.

        <p>

      <h3>My work</h3>
      <p>
        This page shows the examples of tanks that I paint, not limited to. When I am able to attach my own photos of my work, I will provide examples of that. 
        It will also show photos of the supplies that I use. If you have any additional questions, my email is on this website. I also respond to calls and text messages.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        My navigation bar will be a transparent bar that goes with the image beneath it. Which will be my logo image and will set the color scheme for my page.

      <h3>Prices and Rates</h3>
      <p>         
        There will be a button to set up reservations, but i don't think I will be able to get that operating in time, but it is a future project for this website.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        I will most likely add some more photos to this page, I just wanted to be able to keep my wireframe at a decent length.
